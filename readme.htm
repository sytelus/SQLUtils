                        1. Point it to a SQL Server table or query and it can generate INSERT script for
                        that data. This is useful if you want to deploy small amount of default data as
                        part of your database build. For large dataset, it might be benefitial to use features
                        such as BCP.</p>
                    <p>
                        2. It can recompile all SPs in database using a hack that was found by experimentation
                        so if there are errors after a database build, they might get caught before user
                        attempts to run them causing them to recompile at that time (so far with SQL Server
                        2005, not all the errors would be reported at recompile time - some will be reported
                        ONLY when the code actually gets executed at runtime).</p>
